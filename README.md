This is the application I use to share my code snippets (you can call them mini-tutorials) at http://snippets.dinduks.com.

Installation:

* Execute `bundle install`
* Setup your credentials as environment variables: `FURRY_USERNAME` and `FURRY_PASSWORD`  
For local development on Unix systems:
      export FURRY_USERNAME = "skullfist"
      export FURRY_PASSWORD = "nofalsemetal"
I suggest saving these in your `~/.bashrc` file.
* Visit `/new` to add a new snippet
